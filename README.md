Remote-Plug-Control-Server
==========================

This project is about developing a continuously running service on a raspberry pi to access and control every remote plug within its range. The plugs will be controllable with every internet-capable device.

You will need to install a webserver first to run this project on your Raspberry Pi.
Therefore just follow this tutorial:

After lighttpd is installed you need to:
-put the files in the directory /var/www/
-make the scripts executable "sudo visudo"
